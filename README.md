My app, which I call Illusion, takes a YouTube link and the celebrityâ€™s name from the user, and it detects whether the video is real or a deepfake. The app also has the capability for any user to submit new videos of celebrities to train the model, so that over time with each submission the model improves. The unique model for each celebrity approach used in my app is effective for detecting deepfakes of identifiable celebrities or public figures as it is easy to find real videos of these figures. Such an app can drive awareness about the risk of false information and can be used by any non technical user to easily check the authenticity of any video. For this prototype, my App only works for celebrity videos as they are easily available in the public domain and can be used for training. With this capability, we can increase awareness and create a much safer and trustworthy online experience for teenagers and the general public.
